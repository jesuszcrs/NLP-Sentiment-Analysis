# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis

## NLP Sentiment Analysis (Product Reviews):

## Overview:
This script performs sentiment analysis on product reviews to determine whether they express positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. It uses logistic regression as the classification algorithm and leverages the scikit-learn and NLTK libraries for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Usage:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk.
Prepare your dataset in CSV format with 'text' and 'label' columns, where 'text' contains the review text and 'label' contains the corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).
Update the script with the correct path to your dataset (reviews_dataset.csv).
Run the script. It will preprocess the text data, train the sentiment analysis model, and evaluate its performance on a held-out test set.
The script will output the accuracy and classification report, showing precision, recall, F1-score, and other metrics.

## Dependencies:
Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
nltk

## Dataset:
You can use publicly available datasets for sentiment analysis, such as the Amazon Product Review dataset or the IMDb Movie Review dataset. Alternatively, you can collect your own dataset from online sources or use APIs provided by e-commerce platforms.
